Questions/notes (Dec. '16):


npm install express? (Error: Cannot find module 'express')

package.json via npm process - entry point index.js

Set up:
- ignore config files?

Node:
- node/v6.6.0 - or install 6.9.1?
- Start server w/ npm start?

API:
- JSON doesn't seem to be supported > using npm path/xmlToJSON.js


Express lecture:
- Express requires middleware, listens for requests & passes req & resp objects to request handler via routeHandler
- routeHandler can change the obj to add functionality - it handles the requests
- Middleware takes 3 arg: resp, req, & next (like callback)
- Next is primary request handler, which will send the response back or invoke a function, etc.

- Need app.use to apply the MW


// Wasn't sure re using Chatterbox server approach vs. the one in Angular sprint
// Joseph said to use the one in Shortly Express; server will just serve the static page
